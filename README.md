# Glühende Colt WebApp

**Procedure**

1. UI and the design was created, it is important thateverything is user friendly and
   responsive.
2. Backend built and the first API calls set up
3. Database set up
4. The backend is connected to the database and functionsare created that will be
   called in the frontend.
5. The API is built on the server side that calls thesefunctions to be able to use them in
   the frontend.
6. The frontend logic is built
7. Details rework (error detection etc.)
8. WebApp is thoroughly tested.
   **Database structure**

- The database is kept very simple as it is sufficientfor all functions of the app, therefore no ER
  model is necessary or useful.
- It contains a single table named "users”

**Technology used (Node.js , React, Material-UI, SQlite,express-js)
Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment basedon Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

```
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React was released by Facebook in 2013 and is usedby many big names (WhatsApp,
Instagram, Tesla...). It is responsible for the logicand the interface.
```

```
Material-UI includes React components for faster and easier web development. As a result,
we get a beautiful and optimized user interface.
Material-UI is a version of "Material-Design" createdfor React.
Material-Design is a design standard invented by Google.
```

```
SQlite is a C language library that implements a small,fast, self-contained, highly reliable and
fully functional SQL database engine. SQLite is themost widely used database engine in the
world. SQLite is built into all cell phones and mostcomputers, and is included in countless
other applications that people use every day.
```

```
express-js is a simple and flexible Node.js frameworkof web applications that provides many
powerful features and functions for web applicationsand mobile applications.
```
